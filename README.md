### Hi there 👋

- My name is Marian Farah. I grew up in Syria 🇸🇾, and I currently live in the USA 🇺🇸
- I have a PhD in Bayesian Statistics, and I work in the AI space
- I am passionate about using science and AI to help create a more sustainable future 🌍 🌏 🌎
- Why Frogstar World B? Because it is the location of [The Restaurant at the End of the Universe](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Frogstar_World_B) 😄
- These days you will find me playing with LLMs
